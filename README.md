# Human Tools - Toolbox

[humantools.io](https://humantools.io/)

This is the project that will include a collection of simple tools around the same principles.

- No user data is ever uploaded to any server
- All processing happens on users devices
- No need to install software on your devices

# What's Built?

- Combile PDF - A simple tool allows users to drag and drop arbitrary PDF files and merge them together. The tool allows users to re-arrange pages by drag-n-drop to reorder pages before downloading the final PDF. All of that is done without uploading any user data to servers. It's all processed on the user device.

# Deploying New Version

Once changes are merged into master the app is automatically built and deployed by netlify.
